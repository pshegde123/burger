# Eat-Da-Burger!
An app uding NodeJS,Express,Handlebars and MySQLt hat lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

This app is done as part of Georgia Tech Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp.


### Description
This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with `HTML/CSS` and elements from the `Bootstrap` framework and the backend implemented with `Node.js` and `Express`. HTML templating is done with the help of `Handlebars`.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the `MySQL` database. The initial burger entry is added as available on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the adjacent column and updates its status accordingly in the database.
